# Downloading-PubMed-Abstracts

Python code that allows you to download PubMed Abstracts according to some Keywords

in this code i've tried to download abstracts using one keyword or many different keywords and then save the abstracts to CSV file 

you can use more than one keywords at once like this : search_term = "Coronary Artery Bypass" ==> search_term = "Coronary Artery Bypass" and "open heart"

this code can help you in Domain Adaptation step where you train transformer model on a very precise data related to a specific domain.
