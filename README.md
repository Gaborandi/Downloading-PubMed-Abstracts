# Downloading-PubMed-Abstracts
Python code that allows you to download PubMed Abstracts according to Keywords

in this code i've tried to download abstracts using 2 different keywords ("Coronary Artery Bypass" and "open heart") and then save the abstracts to CSV file

this code can help you in Domain Adaptation step where you train transformer model on a very precise data related to a specific domain.
